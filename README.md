# Flutter Inifinte Scroll with  BLoC 📲️

This is an example about how can you use [infinite_scroll_pagination](https://pub.dev/packages/infinite_scroll_pagination) using BLoC pattern, in this case with [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc). I faced some difficulties to find this kind of example using the both flutter favorite libraries, so, I hope this will help you. 😄
